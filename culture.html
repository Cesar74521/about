				<h1>Tourism <button onclick="show(4)">Watch video <i class="far fa-play-circle"></i></button></h1>
				<p>Spain is one of the world’s biggest tourist destinations, welcoming over 83 million visitors in 2019. While many are attracted to the country’s sun, sea and sangria, there is much more to the country than its (amazing) beaches. We take a look at some of Spain’s must-visit attractions.</p>
				<h4>SAGRADA FAMILIA</h4>
				<p>Barcelona architect Antoni Gaudí began work on the Sagrada Familia in 1883 and it remains unfinished to this day. His other-worldly design, featuring his signature mosaics and modernist flourishes, is due to be completed in 2026, the centenary of Gaudí’s death.</p>
				<h4>THE ALHAMBRA</h4>
				<p>The magnificent Moorish fortress sitting on a hill above Granada is one of Spain’s most-visited tourist sites for good reason. Its beautiful mosaics, marble fountains and intricate detailing are some of the best-preserved examples of Islamic architecture in the world.</p>
				<h4>THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE OF ART</h4>
				<p>Madrid’s golden triangle of art museums holds some of the world’s most famous works. From the Spanish masters of the Prado to Picasso’s masterpiece Guernica in the Reina Sofía and the eclectic collection of the Thyssen-Bornemisza, you can’t leave Madrid without discovering its rich artistic heritage.</p>
				<h4>GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM</h4>
				<p>Frank Gehry’s design for Bilbao’s Guggenheim Museum has quickly become a classic of contemporary architecture since it was inaugurated in 1997. Gehry called upon the city’s industrial and seafaring heritage in the design of the museum, a giant, curved, boat-like structure made of titanium and glass.</p>
				<h4>LA RIOJA</h4>
				<p>Spain has the largest number of vineyards of any country in the world, and nowhere are they more beautiful than in the Rioja wine region. It’s the ideal place to discover Spanish wine, tour some vineyards and explore the beautiful Spanish landscape.</p>
				<h4>THE TABERNAS DESERT</h4>
				<p>Tabernas Desert, in southeastern Spain, doesn’t feel like Spain at all. Its arid landscapes have doubled for the Wild West in films such as The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966), and since many spaghetti westerns used it for filming in the 1960s, it has become a favourite location for Hollywood shoots.</p>
				<h4>SALAMANCA’S PLAZA MAYOR</h4>
				<p>One of Spain’s most beautiful squares, Salamanca’s Plaza Mayor is, like many other buildings in the city, constructed from sandstone. It is a good example of the city’s Baroque architecture and is a popular meeting place, lined with cafés and restaurants.</p>
				<h4>BALEARIC ISLAND</h4>
				<p>Whether it’s laid-back Menorca, family-friendly Mallorca or hedonistic Ibiza, Spain’s Balearic Islands are a popular holiday destination for all ages. From partying the night away in Ibiza’s clubs to cycling around Mallorca and lazing on the islands’ incredible beaches, however you prefer to spend your holidays, the Balearics are the perfect location.</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Corrida De Toros (Bullfigting)

					</li>
					<li>Tapas
						<p>The Spanish bar-hopping culture is something no Spaniard can live without. Whether you live in a city or a village, evening time is always reserved for catching up with friends over drinks.</p>
					</li>
					<li>Flamenco
						<p>Art is an inherent part of Spain in all it’s forms but especially in dance. The world-famous Spanish dance of Flamenco is nothing but a wonder to see live. Having roots in Andalusia, Flamenco is a very difficult dance form.</p>
					</li>
					<li>Ibiza
						<p>All great things come in small packages, they say and it is absolutely true in the case of Ibiza. A tiny island off the east coast of Spain, Ibiza is the party hub of not only Europe, but the entire world. Famous for it’s never-ending and all-night-long parties, Ibiza is the most happening place for youngsters to unwind and lose themselves in music. Shacks on beach which serve food and drinks are where all the action is. Live music is played in every shack and the place is popular for giving birth to some of the best EDM musicians in the world and Ibiza remains the party place that every teenager wants to be at.</p>
					</li>

					</li>
					<li>Paella
						<p>Spanish cuisine is one of the most diverse cuisines in the world thanks to the various diverse regions of Spain. Every region has something unique to offer to the eaters and Paella is just one of the many great things.</p>

La Liga is their national tournament for which every club takes part. La Copa Del Rey is another one of their tournaments. Spain has many clubs but the top 2 are of course – Real Madrid and Barcelona.</p>
					</li>
					<li>La Sagrada Familia
						<p>Anyone who knows even a little about art and Spain will know about the famous Gaudi. Antoni Gaudi was a Catalan architect who has in essence, designed a lot of buildings in Barcelona. He is famous for the incorporation of colors and quirks in his art. Although he has built many monumental things, his magnum opus remains La Sagrada Familia.</p>

				<h1>Religion <button onclick="show(6)">Watch video <i class="far fa-play-circle"></i></button></h1>
				<p>Like much of Europe, the most widely practiced religion in Spain is Roman Catholicism. Not only do the vast majority of Spaniards identify as Catholic (about 70%), but the history of Spain is strongly rooted in Catholic tradition.</p>
				<p>Alcalá itself is home to several historical gothic style churches, and during Semana Santa (Holy Week) Alcalá comes alive with religious ceremony and spirit.</p>
				<p>Still, the vast majority people in Alcala, and the rest of Spain, do not actually attend church regularly. This is particularly true of the younger generations. So while Catholicism continues to play in Spanish culture, and most people do identify as Catholic, it is not a very “religious” country in the sense most people do not go to mass more than a few times per year.</p>
				<p>Finally, in addition to Catholicism, other religions have played an important role in the formation of Spanish culture (although they historically suffered from much persecution) – Islam and Judaism in particular. Because Spain’s territory used to be under Arab control, there are many important historical Islamic sites in Spain, and much architecture with Islamic influence.</p>
				<p>In addition, there are some famous Jewish sites just a 30-minute train ride from Alcala, in Toledo. In Alcala itself, you can see the old “barrio Judio” (Jewish neighborhood), and the old “barrio musulmán” (Muslim neighborhood) both near Calle Santiago.</p>
				<p>Overall, the mix between the historical influences of Islam and Christianity, with the strong historical and current presence of Catholic tradition, makes Alcala a rich city for religious and cultural learning.</p>

				</div>
				<h1>Languages <button onclick="show(8)">Watch video <i class="far fa-play-circle"></i></button></h1>
				<p>The languages of Spain, or Spanish languages, are the languages spoken or once spoken in Spain.</p>
				<p>Most languages spoken in Spain belong to the Romance language family, of which Spanish is the only language which has official status for the whole country. Various other languages have co-official or recognised status in specific territories, and a number of unofficial languages and dialects are spoken in certain localities.</p>
				<h4>- Present-day languages</h4>
				<p>In terms of the number of speakers and dominance, the most prominent of the languages of Spain is Spanish (Castilian), spoken by about 99% of Spaniards as a first or second language. According to a 2019 Pew Research survey, the most commonly spoken languages at home other than Spanish were Catalan in 8% of households, Valencian 4%, Galician 3% and Basque in 1% of homes.</p>
				<h4>- Distribution of the regional co-official languages in Spain:</h4>
				<p>Aranese, a variety of Occitan co-official in Catalonia. It is spoken in the Pyrenean comarca of the Aran Valley (Val d'Aran), in north-western Catalonia. It is a variety of Gascon, a southwestern dialect of the Occitan language. <br>
				Basque, co-official in the Basque Country and northern Navarre (see Basque-speaking zone). Basque is the only non-Romance language (as well as non-Indo-European) with an official status in mainland Spain. <br>
				Catalan, co-official in Catalonia and in the Balearic Islands. It is recognised but not official in Aragon, in the area of La Franja. Outside of Spain, it is the official language of Andorra; it is also spoken in the Pyrénées-Orientales department in southernmost France, and in the city of Alghero on the island of Sardinia, where it's co-official with Italian.</p>
				<p>Valencian (variety of Catalan), co-official in the Valencian Community. Not all areas of the Valencian Community, however, are historically Valencian-speaking, particularly the western side. It is also spoken without official recognition in the area of Carche, Murcia.</p>
				<p>Galician, co-official in Galicia and recognised, but not official, in the adjacent western parts of the Principality of Asturias (as Galician-Asturian) and Castile and León. <br>
				Spanish is official throughout the country; the rest of these languages have legal and co-official status in their respective communities and (except Aranese) are widespread enough to have daily newspapers and significant book publishing and media presence. Catalan and Galician are the main languages used by the respective regional governments and local administrations. A number of citizens in these areas consider their regional language as their primary language and Spanish as secondary.</p>
				<p>In addition to these, there are a number of seriously endangered and recognised minority languages:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Aragonese, recognised, but not official, in Aragon.</li>
					<li>Asturian, recognised, but not official, in Asturias.</li>
					<li>Leonese, recognised, but not official, in Castile and León. Spoken in the provinces of León and Zamora.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Spanish itself also has distinct dialects. For example, the Andalusian or Canarian dialects, each with their own subvarieties, some of them being partially closer to the Spanish of the Americas, which they heavily influenced to varying degrees, depending on the region or period and according to different and non-homogeneous migrating or colonisation processes.</p>
				<p>Five very localised dialects are of difficult filiation: Fala, a variety mostly ascribed to the Galician-Portuguese group; Cantabrian and Extremaduran, two Astur-Leonese dialects also regarded as Spanish dialects; Eonavian, a dialect between Asturian and Galician, closer to the latter according to several linguists; and Benasquese, a Ribagorçan dialect that was formerly classified as Catalan, later as Aragonese, and which is now often regarded as a transitional language of its own. Asturian and Leonese are closely related to the local Mirandese which is spoken on an adjacent territory but over the border into Portugal. Mirandese is recognised and has some local official status.</p>
				<p>With the exception of Basque, which appears to be a language isolate, all of the languages present in mainland Spain are Indo-European languages, specifically Romance languages. Afro-Asiatic languages, such as Arabic (including Ceuta Darija) or Berber (mainly Riffian), are spoken by the Muslim population of Ceuta and Melilla and by recent immigrants (mainly from Morocco and Algeria) elsewhere.</p>
				<h4>- Portuguese and Galician</h4>
				<p>Linguistic opinion is divided on the matter of the relationship between Galician and Portuguese. Some linguists, such as Lindley Cintra, consider that they are still dialects of a common language, despite differences in phonology and vocabulary. Others, such as Pilar Vázquez Cuesta, argue that they have become separate languages due to major differences in phonetics and vocabulary usage, and, to a lesser extent, morphology and syntax. The official and widespread position (followed by the Galician Language Institute and the Royal Galician Academy) is that Galician and Portuguese should be considered independent languages.
				<br>
				In any case, the respective written standards are noticeably different one from another, partly because of the divergent phonological features and partly due to the usage of Spanish orthographic conventions over the Portuguese ones at the time of Galician standardisation by the early 20th century.
				<br>
				A Galician-Portuguese-based dialect known as Fala is locally spoken in an area sometimes called Valley of Jálama/Xálima, which includes the towns of San Martín de Trevejo (Sa Martin de Trevellu), Eljas (As Elhas) and Valverde del Fresno (Valverdi du Fresnu), in the northwestern corner of Cáceres province, Extremadura.
				<br>
				Portuguese proper is still spoken by local people in three border areas:
				<br>
				The town of La Alamedilla, in Salamanca province.
				The so-called Cedillo-horn, including Cedillo (in Portuguese Cedilho) and Herrera de Alcántara (in Portuguese Ferreira de Alcântara).
				The town of Olivenza (in Portuguese Olivença), in Badajoz province, and its surrounding territory, which used to be Portuguese until the 19th century and is still claimed by Portugal.
				</p>
				<h4>- Past languages</h4>
				<p>In addition to the languages which continue to be spoken in Spain to the present day, other languages which have been spoken within what are now the borders of Spain include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Tartessian language</li>
					<li>Iberian language</li>

					<li>Classical Arabic</li>
					<li>Judeo-Arabic</li>
					<li>Mozarabic languages</li>

				</ul>
				<p>Languages that are now chiefly spoken outside Spain but which have roots in Spain are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Judeo-Catalan, though the existence of this language has been questioned.</li>
					<li>Judeo-Spanish (Ladino)</li>
				</ul>
